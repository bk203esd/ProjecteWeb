Deployment proposal:

Our application will be a 3-layer project:
- Web Layer
- Application Layer
- Database Layer

We will not have a Session Storage Layer because it is not necessary in our project as we will not be working with session storage.

Number of servers and role of each one:
We will have, at least 3 servers. These servers will be each for one of the layers. The number of servers, however, can be increased to increase the performance and scalability of the application.
The roles of each server will be the following:

1. Web Layer Server: This server will be running NGINX and managing incoming traffic.

2. Application Layer Server: This server will be running Django and managing the application’s logic.

3. Database Layer Server: This server will be running PostgreSQL, storing all the data the application needs.

Connections and dependencies between servers:
1. Web - Application: These two servers will be connected through HTTP requests.
2. Application - Database: These two servers will be connected through psycopg2.
3. This means that, indirectly, the web server will be connected to the database via the application, thus creating a dependency between the Web Server and the Application Server.


Required servers:
We require 3 servers. These are a single server for each of the layers. The role of each server has been defined above. We would require a 4th server if we had considered a Session Storage Layer.

Optional servers:
We may have multiple optional servers for each of the layers. In each of the cases, they will be increasing the layer’s performance and scalability.
